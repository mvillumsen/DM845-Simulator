Build a simple simulator that simulates data for WhatsHap and run WhatsHap on the data

=== INPUT ===
- FASTA-file (Reference with one chromosome)
    Assume no Ns
    All letters should be in uppercase
    Header starts with ">"
    The rest

- .VCF-file (like WhatsHap)
    sample: assume it is always 01

- Number of reads (1000000)
- Error prob. (10%)
- Read length (1000)


=== OUTPUT ===
- (See testdata from WhatsHap)
- .sam-file
    @: header
    SN: should correspond to the VCF-file


=== PROGRAM ===
1. Read both files
2. Save a copy of the FASTA-file in array/string (the chromosome)
3. Generate an altered version of the chromosome based on the .VCF-file
4. Generate the reads based on the below algorithm
5. Output as a .sam-file

=== ALGORITHM ===
1. Choose chrm_1 or chrm_2 at random (one is without errors and one is with)
2. Choose a start position at random
3. Go over all letters in the read and change each letter with the given probability
    Probability for mutation: E.g. 1/400 + a random number between 0-100
4. Repeat for the number of reads.
