# DNA Read Simulator
##### Made for Advanced Algorithms for Computational Biology (DM845) at SDU

This read simulator is made with the purpose of generating long reads which will be used with whatshap, a software for phasing genomic variants using DNA sequencing reads, also called haplotype assembly.
